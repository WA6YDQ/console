This is a simple console application for setting frequency
and mode for rtl dongles. It runs in Python3 using the tkinter
library.

You must have a working installation of rtl_fm (and working hardware!)
and python 3 installed.

You must also have tkinter for python3 installed. If not, and you are 
running Linux (debian and it's derivitives) you can get them with:

sodo apt-get install python3 python3-tk

This was written on and for a raspberry pi 0 but should work
anywhere Linux and python and rtl-fm works.

This is (as of April 2018) very rudimentary. I'll add to it
as I have time.
